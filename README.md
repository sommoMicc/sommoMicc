I like to call myself a __geek__. 

Regarding information technology, I love to try always new things. 
I am passionate about web and mobile development, but recently I have also approached the field of artificial intelligence / machine learning.
As a freelance developer I created a few Android and Flutter apps, even just to try some new technologies. 
I have the passion for device modding: I constantly change ROMs on the phone and system operating on the computer. Some of my projects (including drafts) are available on my GitHub.

I like to practice sports to keep myself fit and healthy.
